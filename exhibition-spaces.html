                        explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us.
                        We'll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a
                        bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.

                    <p> For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins.
                        Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution
                        we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                    </p>
                    <p> Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our
                        time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn't survive, including our
                        Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

                    <p> For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks
                        to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of
                        medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including  the discovery of penicillin and the
                        first heart transplant.
